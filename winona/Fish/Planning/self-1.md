## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?
    ### Answer:
    Yes this is the Gateway API.


  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games
  ### Answer:
  This is will be handled in the Gameplay Service System.


  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components
### Answer:
This will be handled in the sign-up system.


- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games
### Answer:
Yes, this is the first & second demo milestone.



  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 
### Answer:
Yes, this is the third demo milestone.



  - for running remote tournaments on a network
### Answer:
Yes, this is the fourth & fifth demo milestone.




- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?



  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?



  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?



  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?


  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)


### Answer: 
We completed this planning to best of our abilities and that includes ensuring proper english. Each paragrah, is dedicated to single topic (we even bolded the topic), and each sentence is made to make a point that builds on the previous sentence. Grammar was checked before submission. 


The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
